*** Starting up ***

Currently, this can *NOT* daemonize, so must be run in screen or something
similar. It is a known missing feature from the standalone server. Our alternative
is to use an FCGI backend, which is much more overhead.

$ plackup -s Standalone::Prefork --port 9042 --timeout 10 --max-reqs-per-child 1000 -a psgi/geoip.psgi

*** Updating the database ***

The database lives in C<psgi/GeoIP.dat>. Updating this file should be
seemless and picked up by the server.
