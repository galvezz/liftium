*** Starting up ***

Currently, this can *NOT* daemonize, so must be run in screen or something
similar. It is a known missing feature from the standalone server. Our alternative
is to use an FCGI backend, which is much more overhead.

$ plackup -s Standalone::Prefork --port 9042 --timeout 10 --max-reqs-per-child 1000 -a psgi/geoip.psgi

*** Usage ***

The server will return the country data for an IP in JSON format, like this:

  Geo={"country":"US"}

There are 3 ways an IP address can be passed to the server, and the server
will go down this list until it finds an address:

 1) Explicitly as a URL paramater, like:
    $ curl "http://localhost:9042/?4.0.1.1"

 2) Via a proxy, like:
    $ curl -H "X-Forwarded-For: 194.109.6.66" http://localhost:9042
    
 3) Directly using the client IP, like:
    $ curl http://localhost:9042/

*** Updating the database ***

The database lives in C<psgi/GeoIP.dat>. Updating this file should be
seemless and picked up by the server.
