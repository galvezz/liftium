"""apachelogs.py: code for reading and parsing Apache log files.

Sample use -- counting the number of 40xs seen:

  import apachelogs

  alf = ApacheLogFile('access.log')
  40x_count = 0
  for log_line in alf:
    if log_line.http_response_code.startswith('40'):
      40x_count += 1
  alf.close()
  print "Saw %d 40x responses" % 40x_count
